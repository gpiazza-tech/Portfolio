                        earned my CompTIA A+ certification in January 2026, and I am always looking for projects I can use as an
                        excuse to drill my technical skills.

                        <p>If there's one thing I thought I knew a lot about before taking the A+, it would be operating
                            systems. It turns out there is so much more to troubleshooting Windows 11 then simply checking
                            task manager. Since passing the A+, I have learned so much about using other troubleshooting
                            tools such as control panel, microsoft maneagement console, and the command line. I am now not
                            only more than capable of troubleshooting Windows, but also MacOS and Linux.

                        <p>I have been working in fast food since April of 2025, and I have learned so much about how to
                            treat customers, how to work in a professional team environment, and how to deal with stressful
                            situations. I am proud to say that I am a valuable addition to the company, and I was awarded
                            an employee of the month certificate in September for my dedication and enthusiasm.

                        <p>Out of all the huge projects I have and currently am working on, my proudest creation is my home network.
                            The A+ is a great resource for learning the basics of servers and networking, but the amount I have learned
                            from the A+ is nothing compared to what I've learned from building a home network. There really isn't a
                            better way to learn about the different parts of a PC then buying the components from ebay and building
                            one yourself.

                            I've branched away from this language in the last few years, and I have some amount of experience
                            in C++, Python, Java, and many others. Throughout my programming journey, I have made countless
                            applications, a few of which are available on my github.

                            language so much that I then started making simple games in Unity.

                            video games. I followed a video series on making a UDP-based server and a web-based game client in
                            javascript. While that project was ultimately abandoned, it was my first time introduced to networking.

                            playing video games. This was my motivation to learn how to build my own gaming PC, and I learned so much
                            about the anatomy of computers. The PC I ended up with is still my primary computer to this day, and
                            ironically it is rarely used for gaming anymore.

                            It was a long and wild ride, but I finally achived the certification in January of 2026, and I learned
                            about so many areas of IT that I didn't even know existed before.
